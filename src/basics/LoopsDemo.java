/*
* If we want to execute a block of code for certain number of times then 
* we are going to use loops
* Every loop will have three parts
* 1. initialization
* 2. condition
* 3. increment or decrement

* In Java we have mainly 4 types of loops
* Infinite loop: A loop which will run forever
* 
* 1. while loop
* 		initialization;
* 		while(expression){
* 			statements;
* 			increment/decrement;
* 		}
*  While will verify the condition first then only it'll execute the statements. 
* 	i.e If the while condition is true then the statements inside the while block will be executed
* 	The minimum iteration count is 0
* 	
* 2. do while loop
* 		initialization;
* 		do{
* 			statements;
* 			increment/decrement;
* 		}while(expression);
*  do-while loop will execute the statement inside the do block for first time then it will verify 
*  the condition of while . If it is true then the statements inside do block will repeat execution 
*  else do-while block will be terminated.
*  The minimum iteration count is 1
* 
* 3. for loop
* 		for(initialization; expression; increment/decrement){
* 			statements;
* 		}
* The minimum iteration count is 0
* 
* 4. for-each loop
* 		It is used iterate over an array or collection
* 		for(array_type var_name : array_var_name){
* 			statements;
* 		}
* 
* 
* we can terminate the loop based on some expression using "break" statement
* we can skip the current iteration of the loop based on some condition using "continue" statement
